# Crypto Trading Program
> You can find the live demo for this project [here]() (coming soon). Check out [my website](https://wcepress4.github.io/) for any updates.
## Introduction
------------
This is the repository for an autonomous trading program that is designed to optimize cryptocurrency investments, ensuring continuous operation for maximizing profits. 
It utilizes a technical strategy algorithm to strategically execute trades based on market indicators.
Integrated with the [Bitget RestAPI](https://bitgetlimited.github.io/apidoc/en/spot/#restapi) to seamlessly execute orders in response to signals.

I created this project during the summer of 2022, but just got around to posting my code here :)

## Usage
------------
Obtain an API passphrase, API key, and API secret key from your [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/) spot account and add these details to the beginning of the script where specified **[insert here]**.

## Contributing
------------
